# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
  This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.
  
###  Dataset
    Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
    
###  Files
##### CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
    
##### run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
  + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#####  FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
